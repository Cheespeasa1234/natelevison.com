                    This project was a school assignment to make any game you want. I chose to make a game based on my favorite game series of all time, Bloons Tower Defense. And by "based on", I mean I stole assets and game mechanics without credit. I still have to add more waves and stuff, but the structure is there and ready to be extended.

                    Based on the mobile game Little Alchemy, I made this game in order to display some object oriented methods of coding which I have never really tried out before. Also, because my sisters loved the game, it would help me connect with them. It was a struggle to get graphics working but I made some pretty cool animations in the game.

                    Meant to be a succesor to SchedUhler, the scheduling program made by my teacher and used by the school, this program is a visual tracking program. It shows you all the classes / appointments you have that day, and visualizes how far through the day you are. It has been a great resource for myself and a great learning opportunity as well. It has its own file format as well, which I think is really cool.

                    This is a Java library that I coded, which implements the features of arrays that I wish were available in Java. Although the ArrayList class is by all means sufficient for most purposes, I found that it was not as easy to use as I would have liked. This library is meant to be a more user friendly version of ArrayList, with more features and a more intuitive documentation.

                    In my CS1 class, we had to make the space invaders game. I put in a lot of effort so I thought it would be cruel to not put this in my portfolio. I tried my best to make it as similar to the original as possible.

                <p class="project-desc">
                    Boomshine is a very satisfying game to play. I coded it from scratch, which meant I had to learn a lot about how to do movement in code. This means I learned how to use sine and cosine, how to calculate movement, and calculating collisions accurately. It was a great learning experience and a great playing experience as well!

                    My first full game, Flappy Bord is an entirely original game that I made from scratch without any help from my peers. Just kidding, of course. This game helped me learn lots of features of the Java language, and helped me learn how to make games in general. I also made some of my own assets for this project, which was fun!

                    This is my first ever java project. I used it to keep track of my progress over time as I got better with learning Java. It started as a console application, and slowly made the transformation into a fully-fledged Java Swing GUI application. I am very proud of it, even though it doesn't really work anymore. Not sure why.
