                        I have a Minecraft world that I share with a friend, and whenever I want to view statistics, it is a huge pain. So, I developed a fully-featured java program that parses NBT and JSON data, and displays tons of useful information about Minecraft players, such as statistics, inventory, and even a world map.

                        This project was a school assignment to make any game you want. I chose to make a game based on my
                        favorite game series of all time, Bloons Tower Defense. And by "based on", I mean sloten assets and
                        game mechanics without credit. I enjoyed the learning that came along with developing this game.

This library is meant to be a more user friendly version of ArrayList, with more features and a more intuitive documentation.

                        Boomshine is a very satisfying game to play. I coded it from scratch, which meant I had to learn a

                        calculate movement, and calculating collisions accurately. It was a great learning experience and a
                        great playing experience as well!

                        this project, which was fun!

                        with learning Java. It started as a console application, and slowly made the transformation into a
                        fully-fledged Java Swing GUI application. I am very proud of it, even though it doesn't really work
                        anymore. Not sure why.

                        For my CS class, we had to make a Pong game but customize it. I don't know why I called it pain pong but it sounded cool, I guess.

                        This is just a crappy paint brush app. It helped me learn some efficiency techniques, like storing things as lines and not pixels. It includes an RGB and size slider, so to do this, I stored each point as a point with size and color, drawing lines between each point with the first's data. It was very fun to make.

It has new features, such as radar (shows you bombs in a radius), rockets (shoots two rays up and down, flagging the first mine it hits), and fog of war, which is a visual feature that took most of the time to develop, but adds a smooth visual element to the game.
