    New post time. I've been reading a book, well not really. I've been reading it for a few hours. I haven't done anything else. Its actually really good. Why don't I write about it, because after all, there isn't even a scrollbar on the list of posts!

    <h3>Nate Levison and books</h3>
    <p>
        My relationship with books hasn't always been very steady. When I was a lot younger, maybe early elementary school, I read all the time. But then, reading started being required by my school. And you know how it goes, once something is retired, everyone hates doing it. As my mom claims, I slowly started loathing books and reading logs. She even protested the school at one point, because they wouldn't let me read a certain book, because it was too high of a level for me (which is stupid).

        And so I hated books, and I kind of still do. I prefer other forms of entertainment, forms that you can choose how to experience. Like video games or coding. I determine how it goes. And that is why I enjoy both of those things. But then I discovered dystopian novels, and <s>everything</s> a bit changed.

    <h3>Dystopian Books</h3>
    <p>
        I discovered dystopian-esque books when I found the I Survived series. I don't remember much, as it was a while ago, but it planted within me an enjoyment of disaster, of society disassembled and in pieces. Not in a messed up way, but in a silly way. I still was in the "dark ages" of reading at that time, but soon my enjoyment of this genre would germinate.

        A few years later, enter middle school, enter Fahrenheit 451. Classic dystopian, great read, bad ending, blah blah blah. But in high school, I found new dystopian books that I loved. H2O, a book about an alien disease that spreads in the rainwater, riverwater, airwater, everywherewater. It was incredible. The Road, mysterious but fun to follow along with the boy and father. 1984, a book that I am constantly reminded of whenever anything slightly inconvenient happens to me. I then read a bunch about WWII.

        But on Wednesday, (9/13/23), I discovered a great book called The Dreamers. It is about a mysterious disease that infects a small town. It causes people to fall asleep, permanently. It's so thrilling, in fact, that I have read about 75% of the book after only a few hours. I am supposed to be reading this for my independent reading in English, but I might need to find another.

        Perhaps I have discovered a newfound passion for reading. Hopefully.
