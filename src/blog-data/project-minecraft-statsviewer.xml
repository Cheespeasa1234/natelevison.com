                I had a Minecraft world that I shared with a friend, and whenever I wanted to view statistics, it was a huge pain. So, I developed a fully-featured java program that parses NBT and JSON data, and displays tons of useful information about Minecraft players, such as statistics, inventory, and even a world map.
