                natelevison.com is my blog, personal portfolio, and long-term passion project that I have been working on since my freshman year of high school. While making it and maintaining it, I have gained skills in full-stack web development, multiple web development technologies, and a passion for writing.
                It is currently on its fourth major iteration- first was a static 000webhost page, second was a better (still static) github.io page, third was a simple node.js / deno backend system, and fourth is a SvelteKit app. I have tended to redesign my website whenever I have completely replaced my skills with better skills, like when I learned backend development, when I improved in server administration, and recently, when I decided to brush off the css cobwebs and start from the ground up.
