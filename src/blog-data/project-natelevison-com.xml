                This website has been my passion project for more than THREE YEARS now. I wrote my college essay about it, I wrote blog articles on it, and some of my writing here has been published in the school magazine! I am so proud of the work I have done for this website. The CSS is far from decent- but I hate CSS, so it's fine.
                It is currently on its fourth major iteration- first was a static 000webhost page, second was a better (still static) github.io page, third was a simple node.js / deno backend system, and fourth is a SvelteKit app. I have tended to redesign my website whenever I have completely replaced my skills with better skills, like when I learned backend development, when I improved in server administration, and recently, when I decided to brush off the css cobwebs and start from the ground up.
