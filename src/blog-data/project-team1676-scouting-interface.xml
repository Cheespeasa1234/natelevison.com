                In the 2024 Robotics season, Crescendo, I built the frontend of the scouting interface. In robotics, teams will scout one another in order to determine what teams would make for a good parter in the playoffs. It is essential to collect lots of data about play style, skill level, speed, and strategy, in order to make a good decision.
                I componentized all my work and made it extendible, and my components and organization are still being used today. It includes paginated forms, a full validation system, and integrates smoothly with the form collection system.
