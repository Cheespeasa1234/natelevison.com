                FRTree, heavily inspired by Linktree, is meant to solve a problem we deal with in robotics. There is no standardized method of communication or collaboration with other teams. This means, if you find a team number or a team name you want to know about, there is no website or social media platform where EVERY team can be found.
                I built a lot of the frontend and most of the backend, utilizing MySQL, SvelteKit, and other backend technologies. Collaborating with my friends, we built a fully-functional application with sign ups, administrator access, and a great user experience. It is absolutely my best backend work.
