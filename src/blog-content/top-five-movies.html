        I recently looked over my Notes page for all the movies I have ever watched. I am bored, so I want to briefly list my top 5 movies of all time. Of course, this is an opinion, and I haven't watched too many movies, but I definitely have loved a few. Well, here they are.

    <h3>#5 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/">Gravity (2013)</a></h3>
    <p>
        What a great movie. It's been a few years since I watched it, but I was at the edge of my seat. It was masterfully filmed (I don't know how to describe it). The plot twists all took place from the perspective of the main character, a feature of movies I tend to like (see #2).
    </p>
    <p>
        I vividly remember two scenes. One, where the main character is floating in space, and she manages to rescue her captain from being struck by space debris. They sit in the air lock, talking. When suddenly, she realizes he isn't actually there, and she's hallucinating. That was CRAZY to realize.
    </p>

        And the part how the debris was orbiting in real time. It was terrifying to watch the debris approach, and how she managed to escape each time. And the sacrifice of her captain at the end was incredible.

        Great movie. I might rewatch this one day. The action was just so incredible.

    <h3>#4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3402138/">Naked Gun 2 (2025)</a></h3>
    <p>
        Hilarious! The gags in this movie were perfectly timed and had me groaning in laughter non-stop. I also watched this with my dad, in the movie theater, and I really valued the time we got to spend together, especially only weeks before I left for college.
    </p>
    <p>
        God, so many gags in this movie deserve mention. But by far my favorite was when Beth walked through the police station, and Dreblin started thinking about how beautiful she was, stuff like "she had hair like the ocean, she was blah blah blah". Then, the camera turns to the rest of the police station, all staring, and they are all monologuing at once. HILARIOUS. I loved it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I honestly didn't pay _too_ much attention to the plot (because I didn't understand it). But the little bits I did understand only accentuated the humor of the movie. I smiled through the whole thing, and my father and I talked about it the whole drive home.

    <h3>#3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/">The Lego Movie (2014)</a></h3>
    <p>
        It's been years since I watched this, but when I watched it as a kid, it truly changed my life. Some of the messages the movie left me with were really important to me, and years later, if you really read into the movie, there is some really deep shit there.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, the most obvious message- be creative with Lego. Right? That's what Lego is about. Now, I'm not gonna discuss how damn expensive Legos are and how people only buy $999.99 packs with explicit instructions, cause I'm guilty of the same. But I think the message to fathers about letting kids be kids is really important. I never went through anything like the kid did, but I'm sure it resonated with many. It's definitely a jab at 40 year old virgins who still play with Lego.
    </p>
    <p>
        This movie is so damn funny. I love how they renamed things: Kragle = krazy glue, bahn die-eed = bandaid, teet-leest = Titleist (golf ball), polish of nay-eel = Nail Polish. They all were great hints for more mature viewers to the main plot twist of the movie.
    </p>
    <p>
        What else? I think this movie just made me really happy. I'll talk about it more, but "Everything Is Awesome" was one of my favorites when I was younger. My mom can attest to this- I would sing it, non stop, in the car. It sort of made me care less about tiny things, and try to look for the good. Did I succeed in this change of mindset? No. But it gave me some hope. And it still stuck with me.
    </p>

        But we need to talk about the wasp in the room. Barely noticeable, but when you see it, you can't forget about it being RIGHT THERE.
