    I've been waiting <i>far</i> too long to say something on an issue very near and dear to my heart and my family. As you read this, you may begin to wonder why this isn't tagged as a rant. Well, it's because anyone who reads this shitty blog ought to hear this message.
</p>

<p>
    <b>I stand with Israel, unconditionally.</b> And if that hurts your feewings, then go shove a stick up your butt and go to Palestine, and tell me how they treat you (They'll kill you for being gay.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a>)
</p>

<p>
    <i>Woah, woah, Nate, why are you so angry?</i> I'll tell you why. Because a sickeningly large amount of people don't realize how brutal, destructive, and cruel Hamas is. They indiscriminately target civilians<a href="#fn2">[2]</a> and don't care AT ALL about human life. In fact, they blow up their own hospitals to get pity and to smear over Israel<a href="#fn3">[3]</a>. And even though Israel is thousands of miles away from my home, Israel is a part of my Jewish identity and soul. It is the only Jewish nation on Earth, and the nation home to so many holocaust survivors. But before I go spiral, lets talk meta.

    <h3>Why it took me so long to talk about this</h3>
    <p>
        One huge issue with the social media climate nowadays is the rampant spread of misinformation. We have all fallen victim to this. And if you say that your news is unbiased, then you are lying. But only today have I realized how terrible this issue is, and it took me so long because of the biased news.
    </p>
    <p>
        You probably heard about the hospital explosion in Israel. I was shocked to see the near instant reaction from the Internet. A cruel, biased, and unfounded reaction. The media instantly jumped on the issue, and blamed Israel as soon as they could. But after a day or two, the world's governments found that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another terrorist group, was solely responsible- killing civilians on their own side <a href="#fn3">[3]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This pattern has repeated countless times throughout this conflict, and even appeared frequently before the seventh. I even experienced this phenomenon in person, today (November 13). One of my peers said to me, "Fuck Israel, man". I looked at him confused, and he instantly jumped into a shpiel about white phosphorus and how Israel is killing innocent Palestinians. I tried to respond and ask about his source, but it didn't seem he wanted a discussion. He wanted to take out his anger on me, a Jew. He knew how closely I value Israel in my heart, and chose to single me out in his anger. I later researched these claims, and they were partially false- the white phosophorus weapons were only allegedly in use against Hezbollah<a href="#fn4">[4]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This cycle made it so hard to follow, comment on, or believe anything I saw about the conflict. Every time something was debunked, supporters of that point moved on to another reason to ostracize Israel, Jews, and anyone who didn't blindly support terrorists. Additionally, I struggled to motivate myself to commentate on this issue, as it is so emotional and so easy to become a target by speaking out about it. This is why it took me so long to speak about this, but here we are.

    <h3><s>Antisemitism</s> Jew Hatred</h3>
    <p>
        Jew hatred is very clearly on the rise because of this conflict. However, on the bright side, and I am REALLY sugarcoating this, many people have raised support for Israel and the Jewish people. But the sheer about of misinformation has forced me to cut off most of my social media. The only social media I still even use to this day is Reddit, which is becoming more and more a left-wing circlejerk by the day. It seems every single subreddit you see somehow chooses to comment on this issue. r/publicfreakout, r/facepalm, r/pics, all of these subs share one thing in common- they have become bubbles for hate, anger, and misinformation. I open up one of these subs, and I am taken aback by the misinformation blindly promoting hate. Isn't the whole point of liberalism to be non-hateful? Or is it something more complicated? I understand the <i>concept</i> that there is an oppressor-oppressed dynamic, but vicimizing yourself and an entire population does nothing to further conversation and peace. Victimizing Hamas and the West Bank completely discards any responsibility on the Palestinian end of things- which is not good. Hamas is a terrorist organization. They sacrifice their own people to further their goals<a href="#fn5">[5]</a>, and clearly have stated their goal is to eradicate Judaism from this earth<a href="#fn6">[6]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let me say this very, <i>very</i> clearly: fuck Hamas. And if you support Hamas, I strongly encourage you to re-evaluate your position. And if you stand strong in your terrorist and violent idealogy: fuck you. Go to Gaza. And stay there.
