    <h2>The followup</h2>
    <p>
        It took way too long to write a followup to Forgetting. It got published in Echoes and my whole family saw it. So far, other than my college essay, it is the most impactful / important piece of writing I have ever written. I should have written this immediately after the funeral. But I just couldn't. It hurts.
    </p>

        Unfortunately, I was also almost entirely correct with my predictions. I made the grim prediction that the process of mourning would be similar to that of the stages of Alzheimer's. Taken from the previous article:
    </p>
    
    <p class="quote">
        And is the reaction to [the loss of] a loved one not strangely similar to [Alzheimer's] itself? Mild symptoms - as loved ones hear the news, they are in denial. They refuse to accept the fate of their family member. Moderate symptoms - slowly, the differences in behavior change the identity of the family member in their memory. It takes slightly more time to remember the loved one's true personality. Severe symptoms - the state of their loved one takes a toll on the positive memories once held about that loved one. It takes extreme amounts of effort to look past the disease and see the true person trapped inside. Fatal symptoms - all hope is lost. All efforts are directed to preserving memories and closing any arguments or feuds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That's definitely how the process went. When I wrote Forgetting, I wrote that paragraph to discuss the process of grieving before the loved one even passed away, but the whole process seems to repeat after the fact. And I totally was not prepared.

    <h2>Grieving</h2>
    
    <p>
        Grieving for a loved one with Alzheimers is like grieving someone who already died. At least, that's what my mom told me. And that feels accurate. I haven't sobbed, I haven't truly cried. Because I did that when I found out. That was when my grandma died. Not in bed surrounded by family, but when she forgot more and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        The grieving process starts with "mild" symptoms. Obviously not mild, but small compared to what is to come. These feelings wash over you like a wave. Like jumping into the pool, but you are already wet. It doesn't really hit the same way. My mom told me she died, and I would have cried. But she was already dead at that point. She didn't know how to eat, she didn't know her name, she knew nothing but instinct. What kind of life is that?
    </p>

    <p>
        The moderate symptoms are when you start to realize. At least for me. You move on from the speeches and discussions and shivas all to remember the amazing person lost, and you start thinking about who they were at the end. The person in the photos, the person you are talking about, the person in your memory, is not the same as who they were at the end. Just like before the passing, moderate symptoms include more effort to remember their true personality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then comes severe symptoms. It still feels numb. But it still feels raw. You go a day without thinking about it, and you feel disgusted. How could you forget? How could you not think about her? How dare you live in peace, while your mom is praying every night, and your grandpa sleeps alone for the first time in decades? How do you sleep? I ask myself this hoping for an answer. But it won't come. How can I be happy?

    <h2>Fatal symptoms</h2>

    <p>
        Last comes fatal symptoms.
    </p>

    <p>
        I visited my grandpa a month or two ago. His Florida house. The last house my grandma lived in. And something felt wrong. If you've ever read A Mango Shaped Space by Wendy Mass, you'd know what it feels like to have a grandma shaped hole in the house. It felt uneven. More signs appeared. I looked at the side couch and I saw my grandma laying there, under a yellow blanket. I looked at the Alexa, and I saw my grandma reprimanding my sister after she told it to tell a rude joke. I look at the bed, and I see talking to my grandma until midnight during sleepovers. I look at the pillow, "A golfer and a normal person live here", and although ironic, it isn't funny. It isn't funny. It's wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had a dream a week or so ago. It was something about being with my grandparents talking about colleges. It was a pleasant experience, like nothing was wrong. I woke up, and I thought about the dream. It took a minute before I realized the person I was talking to was dead.
    </p>

    <p>
        The person I used to be is dead as well. My current self is similar, sure, but I'm different now. Some people think the old me is alive. Old friends I haven't seen in years, they remember a different Nate. Old teachers, they remember a different Nate. Grandma, she knew a different Nate. (It's striking- my writing is different too. Slightly more formal, different sentence structure, a few more commas. Quoting that passage from Forgetting really made me realize this.)
    </p>

    <p>
        And we are supposed to remember a different Grandma. For more than a year, we saw everything was wrong. Slight slip ups turn to gaffes turn to nonsense sentences. And it's hard to remember the younger Grandma. That person was already dead by the time we heard the news.
    </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps this is where the idea of souls comes from. I don't particularly subscribe to the belief, but it is interesting to note that personality and existence are different people. My grandma died twice, and I mourned once. But I'm struggling with two deaths.

    <h2>Why I'm remembering</h2>
    
    <p>
        I decided to write this now because of what happened on Friday (August 30, 2024). I was talking to my Honors Literature of the Holocaust teacher. And I discussed a bracelet I purchased for my grandma in italy. I was so excited to give it to her. I never got the chance. She died before I could visit. It had been months since I had seen her when she died.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My mom brought it with her, and she said my grandma smiled when she saw it. I thought it was still there, almost a year later. But my mom showed me it on Thursday. I didn't know it was in our house. I felt sick, and I ran downstairs. That should have been a dead person's bracelet. It was for grandma. But she never truly had it. They whisked away her body, her possessions, signed papers, boom. Dead person. Deal with it, man. Right?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Not to compare my experience with the Holocaust, but I've been reading Diary of a Young Girl. The author is a dead person. Frank wrote the diary as it was going down, and then it abruptly ended. It wasn't written in retrospect, after deep thought and analysis, or with the assistance of a team. It was written day by day, authentically. Similar to my writing on this site. Not really connected to anything, I was just thinking about it.

        Thank you for reading, Grandpa, Grandma, Grandpa, Mom, Dad, and anyone else. I love you all more than you can possibly know. Also consider donating to Monterey Bay Aquarium. They do great work.
