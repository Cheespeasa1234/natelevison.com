        This is my ranking of all the styles of egg I have eaten in recent times. I made three this afternoon for lunch and I decided to put all the styles in this big list.

        Now, yes, there are more than what are listed here, but I don't really know what the other types are (over-easy) and/or I don't remember what they taste like. Maybe I'll update this. But anyway, here are my rankings.

    <h3>#7 Soft Boiled</h3>
    <p>
        Although deviled eggs are another thing, I consider soft boiled eggs to be the devils work. They are AWFUL. When I see a solid egg white, I expect the same for the yolk! But when I cut it in half and the yolk starts to run, even a tiny bit, I am so turned off. I HATE when that happens. It isn't even useful. You can't make egg salad, you can't feed it to a young child, and you have to train yourself to enjoy it! I'm sure if you showed the hen who made the egg how you soft boiled it, it would sob to itself. Truly a disgraceful preparation of an amazing food.

        My final ranking is a 2/10.

    <h3>#6 Sunny Side Up</h3>
    <p>
        I really did not enjoy this type. Although the outer part of the egg was tasty enough, the yolk was an awful experience. I did not like how it felt in my mouth and how runny it was. It freaked me out, as I have been raised to be terrified of raw egg. I just couldn't do it. I took a few bites but threw it out. I didn't dare feed it to the dog.

        My final ranking is a 3/10.

    <h3>#5 Fried</h3>
    <p>
        It's tough for me to distinguish a fried egg from a sunny side up egg, but I do prefer the fried egg simply because it freaks me out less. But not by much. I do like how the yolk doesn't get everywhere, and it feels more consistent the whole way. But the yolk being gooey is not amazing, so it still isn't great.

        My final ranking is a 5/10.

    <h3>#4 Deviled</h3>
    <p>
        Deviled eggs are quite nice. I don't really have them very often, but it is quite pleasant. I enjoy the contrasting flavors and the paprika, and it is a great hors d'oeuvre (had to google that spelling). However, when preparing them, you have to start with hard boiled eggs, and I would rather eat the hard boiled eggs instead of changing them up. However, deviled eggs are some nice variety and a creative type of egg. No complaints.

    <h3>#3 Scrambled</h3>
    <p>
        I consider the scrambled egg to be the standard egg. It is good, not great. Ol' reliable. It is very easy to make and goes great with ketchup. It doesn't go well with much else, though. It takes a lot of effort to ensure even distribution of toppings, and it doesn't always go very well. But it always tastes great and I always clean my plate.

        My final ranking is a 7/10.

    <h3>#2 Omelette</h3>
    <p>
        Omelettes are less consistent than scrambled eggs, but they often taste much better. The texture is much more soft and even, and you can easily add toppings. I usually only add cheese, but many people add veggies or meats and they look very good. I have no complaints about a decent, or even average omelette. However, given the difficulty to make, it isn't perfect.

        My final ranking is a 8/10.

    <h3>#1 Hard Boiled</h3>
    <p>
        I really love hard boiled eggs. They are great for lunch, you can turn them to egg salad, and you can leave them in the fridge for some time before eating them. They are easy to make in bulk and still taste great without any toppings or fat (like spray, butter, or olive oil). The fluffy egg white is always amazing, and although the yolk sometimes is dry, if you soak the whole think in salt water (like in passover) it is so amazing. I love hard boiled eggs.

        My final ranking is a 8.5/10.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        I forgot to make any egg jokes in this article, but my brain is a bit scrambled after writing this. Although I am a bit shell-shocked from the sunny side up egg I made, the omelette I made for lunch was eggcelent. Thank you for reading, grandma, and thats all for today, yolks!
