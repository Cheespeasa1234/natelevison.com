        I'm upset. I'm really upset. The PEDOPHILES running Congress recently "released" the Epstein files- but only already publicly accessible documents. This the most obvious display of the pedophilia ingrained in our congress, our executive branch, and our judiciary system, and other people of power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main reason I am so upset is that <b>Trump LIED</b>. He lied about releasing the files, because he is a <b>PEDOPHILE</b>, and a great friend of Epstein. He said it himself. He even wished Maxwell good luck. Disgusting.

    <h3>No excuse for pedophilia</h3>
    <p>
        Pedophilia is the LEAST redeemability of all the immorality in our world. It is WORSE than sexual assault, more perverted, and causes more damage. But for some reason... no one has gotten in trouble. At least, few people.
    </p>
    <p>
        I say this with my whole heart- pedophiles who show zero remorse, and refuse to confess and acknowledge the damage they have caused deserve nothing more than DEATH. They are not reformable, they serve no purpose in our society, and they have served nothing to our world except harm.

    <h3>"Justice"</h3>
    <p>
        Literally, I can not think of a single reason why a single pedophile should be left alive, except for if they have shown remorse, or it wasn't their fault. And when the "justice" system fails to do its duty to eliminate these criminals, it is the duty of the people to execute justice as it is commanded in our laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        After all, the Declaration of Indepence COMMANDS the people to abolish a government who fails it duties:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        That, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I truly believe this: the people MUST do something to execute their own justice, as our government put immense resources into protecting the corrupt pedophiles in power. And you know EXACTLY what I mean by that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yeah, personally I won't. I don't have the means... but I won't be upset if someone else does. Screw you, NSA, CIA, or FBI. I know my rights. And I'll defend them until the VERY END.

    <h3>Orwell</h3>
    <p>
        I have never been more terrified that Orwell's predictions in Animal Farm and 1984 are coming to fruition. First of all; in Animal Farm, one of the final acts the pigs do is to rewrite their founding documents to permit actions that otherwise would be illegal- like uneven distribution of food and censorship. In the end, everything just returned to tyranny because the government rewrote themselves into a dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last month, the Library of Congress quietly removed sections of Article 1- which contain rules about habeas corpus, limits of federal power, and the rule that says only Congress can set tarrifs. Sure, they later walked it back and said it was a "coding error"... but I don't believe that for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all- how on EARTH does a "coding error" cause a single specific article of the constitution to vanish, let alone the one Trump has been desperately trying to override with his illegal executive orders? AND as a programmer, it's totally bullshit. I have never encountered an error that without any interference, would remove a single specific part of a greater text. Why would that even happen? The whole constitution is one document. BS all the way down.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am TERRIFIED. Trump is actively bending the rules to expand his power to one similar to that of Hitler's power before the Holocaust. Now- I'm not going to expand on that- all I believe is that he is grabbing more power than he should be allowed to have.
    </p>
    <p>
        And don't you dare give me "the people voted for him to do that". Even if they did- which they didn't- HE STILL CAN'T. He isn't able to. It's just not something he CAN do. If I asked my friends if I should be allowed to rob banks, and they say yes, should I be allowed to rob banks? No!
    </p>
    <p>
        1984 and Animal Farm were WARNINGS, not predictions! This is terrible and I will point it out whenever I can, no matter which corrupt political faction attempts to steal our rights. Screw the government, blue and red.

    <h3>Death to pedophiles</h3>
    <p>
        I pray that the Epstein files are finally released, so that the world truly knows the despicable acts that the Clintons, Trumps, and other powerful freaks committed. And yes- because they are pedophiles- and I believe in death to ALL pedophiles... you know. I can't say it because we are in 1984. But I truly believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the assholes in the press have said that "kids shouldn't see those documents so it shouldn't be released". That is SO STUPID. It isn't for children- ITS FOR THE VOTERS. And it's so hypocritical- Trump and his friends RAPED KIDS and SOLD THEM, and now they want to "protect kids from seeing the documents"? Sounds like someone doesn't want to tell the world how much they loved to RAPE CHILDREN. Let me say it again. DONALD TRUMP RAPED CHILDREN, WITH HIS FRIEND AND PARTNER, JEFFREY EPSTEIN.
    </p>
    <p>
        Death to all pedophiles. I look forward to the day that the pedophiles in power take their forever trip to burn in the depths of hell. I'll see them there.
    </p>
