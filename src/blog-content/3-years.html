    I'm a bit late, but on March 11, 2022, I published the first update to the update page of this blog. Here is a quote of it:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        This is the first entry. IDK what to put here. I might put a blog. After all, I did name this file blogtest.html. I kind of have an obligation now. Maybe it will be a coding blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        So lets start, then? I figured out subpages just now. Funny, cause my previous website didn't use those. Turns out it's just as easy as making subfolders. Next task, getting rid of the "something.html" on the nav. I want it to look clean. Lets see if I can figure that out. I also want to make an icon and a title in the tab. That would be cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I have:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Made a subpage</li>
        <li>Made a hub</li>
        <li>Made this site</li>
        <li>Fallen asleep during class</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I know. Very productive. The goal of this, btw, is not to flex my skill, but just to flex my non-skill. I'm pretty bad at this, so I just want to see how far I can get before I die. Pretty cool. Alright goodbye

    Little did I know then that this blog is what got me into college, what kept me calm and collected throughout my high school experience, and the project I am proudest of.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not really sure what to say, and I feel no desire to do an overview of this site, so I just want to say thank you to a few people.
</p>
<p>
    To Grandma Susan- I miss you every day, as do the rest of the family. I think about your kindness and love for your daughters whenever I try to determine if I should do something; as in, is it kind or not. Also, thank you- I'm realizing now this might come off wrong but I dont know how else to say it- thank you for dying. Writing forgetting was a core aspect of my maturing and the reactions I got from people who read it made me realize how I could express myself with words and that many people care about me. You took part in raising me which is something I owe you everything for.
</p>
<p>
    To Grandpa Dennis- Thank you so much for not only being supportive, but for your conversations and debates you share with me. You have (on multiple occassions) prompted me to think critically about many things, which is an important part of adulthood and an important skill in writing. Thank you for letting me interview you for my Holocaust Literature class- my final presentation taught me a lot about you, myself, and my connection to Judaism and L'dor vador.
</p>
<p>
    To Grandma Ilyse- Your commentary and feedback on my blog gave me motivation to continue this blog through the hardest times. Your critique also was the basis for my college essay which took me all the way to The Ohio State University. I write most of my blog articles somewhat addressed to you- as in, when I write, I imagine myself speaking to you. Thank you for giving me an audience so that I didn't feel like I was yelling into the void.
</p>
<p>
    To Grandpa Harold- When Grandma speaks to me, so do you, and so I also owe you thanks for sustaining this blog. Additionally, you have taught me many tactics in writing which I think have strongly influenced my writing style. Although I often say "me and him" and not "him and I", every time I hear those words, I immediately think of you correcting that. Which is funny. Thank you for your amazing input.
</p>
<p>
    To Dad- You work almost every day to support our family, so that I could have a relatively cushy life, typing on a blog on a screen in my basement. Now that I'm moving up and away, we will see what happens, but your support is how I paid for the domain name, the hosting, and every other minute aspect of this site. I couldn't have done it without you.
</p>
<p>
    And to Mom- I often run some of my articles by you before I post them, and over these years, you have stopped a few stinkers from getting out there. But you have also helped me to refine my writing. Our conversations, especially our debate on free will, have inspired and prompted my best pieces of writing. You have helped me grow from a bumbling toddler who can't do anything to a bumbling adult who can't do anything, but with more hair. Thank you for your constant support and influence.
</p>

    Thank you to all of you for the various ways you have supported me. I am now going off to college and I hope to keep updating this website, as it holds so many core memories and important parts of my personality. One day this blog will be rich with various articles about random things, and I look forward to the day I have to add pagination to the results page. Thanks for reading, grandma.
