Fellow Jews of America; What has happened to our core dreams? Our ideals of controlling our own destiny, of owning our future, of global admiration? For millenia, our Jewish fathers and mothers fought tooth and nail, and were admired by so many- but hated by so many more. Yet they didn’t live in fear. They were full of pride for their people, for their accomplishments, and time and time again, despite countless attacks and adversity, they rose up, stronger than before, snatching the jealousy of billions.

Jews of America; why have we lost our pride? We hide our necklaces down our shirts, put our menorahs on our rear windows, abandon tradition in favor of assimilation. We worked our way up from less than dirt to the top of the world, and yet we choose to assimilate and to normalize. We take our time-honored traditions and mold them through the lens of Christ, whose name has been used as impetus for our destruction again and again! Our cherished Hanukkah, the celebration of God’s rescuing of the Maccabees, now reduced to 7 days of gifts and money. What is left to distinguish us from the billions of Christians? Our language, abandoned in favor of normalization with the wider America, has left millions of Jewish children unaware of the language of our fathers. Why have we defined ourselves through the lens of Christianity, instead of what truly makes us unique? And why have we isolated our agnostics, even though they are among our most brilliant minds?

<p>
Jews of America; why have we given up on the debate? We are determined and hard working people. Our fathers and mothers struggled through inspections, antisemitism, and assimilation to set up shop in a germinating America. Our people certainly contributed massively to the development of America into the power it is today, while other people were turned against one another, raising swords over pointless problems. Why have we let our ideology be mutated, deformed, and christianized by the American press? We are not humble and insular people- we are proud, loud, and outgoing!

Jews of America; why have we failed our mission to repair the world? Even when European Jewry was staring down the barrel of a gun; even when Israeli Jews were struggling to understand the terrorist invasion on their soil; even when Jews in Arab countries faced execution and expulsion by the millions; they never reaped the corners of their field, and they never took a container to gather the scraps. In our effort to become isolationist, as the media has portrayed us, we have cropped the corners of our fields, and abandoned our generous behavior. We indulge in luxury country clubs, beach homes, and fancy liquor, while right in front of us, millions face unimaginable peril! African children dying of preventable disease, Syrian civilians attacked  by missiles and rifles, Druze gunned down in the hundreds, coral reefs greying and disintegrating. We have an opportunity to repair the world, and if our ancestors could have access to the success we have now, no doubt that many of these problems would end!

<p>
Jews of America; what happened to our unending determination? Ashkenazis crawled their way out of the jaws of extinction; Jerusalemites persisted for thousands of years, never forgetting their goal; Israelites fled unending slavery under the strong hand of God; and yet we gave up on our quest to leave the world better for our children? When faced with incomprehensible peril, our forefathers continued the battle. Yet we have not stepped up to reform our communities, or control the nonsensical narrative forming before our very eyes. Why haven’t we done anything?
</p>
<p>
Jews of America; now is our time. We have been armed with knowledge and power for many years- but we are too assimilated to feel a need to use them. Let your soul speak to you, and hear the voice of those who came before you, whose graves we step on by abandoning their goals. We inherit a mission to repair the world- seize your hammers, your wrenches, your checkbooks and your notepads, your words and your thoughts- go forth, and make change! After all, Abraham was promised a sky full of stars shining bright- not dwindling sparkles of what could be.
