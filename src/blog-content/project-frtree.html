        FRTree, heavily inspired by Linktree, is meant to solve a problem we deal with in robotics. There is no standardized method of communication or collaboration with other teams. This means, if you find a team number or a team name you want to know about, there is no website or social media platform where EVERY team can be found.

        I built a lot of the frontend and most of the backend, utilizing MySQL, SvelteKit, and other backend technologies. Collaborating with my friends, we built a fully-functional application with sign ups, administrator access, and a great user experience. It is absolutely my best backend work.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
        I was placed onto the project a few weeks into development. Some of the theming and planning had been done. I was originally told to work on the styling, and I also helped organize the styles and make the website consistent (<a href="https://github.com/PioneersTeam1676/FRTree/commit/960e357f8e8f78654e82c9b5a690bb363574c81a">commit 960e357</a>). After some time, the front page was nearing its final layout.

        I then began working on the backend, which could query the database, but had no user functionality. I worked on adding API endpoints for users and libraries. My first change was a patch against SQL injection.
    </p>

        At this point, I had gotten the database in a good state, but there was no data to use. I set up a system which would call the TBA API and get some basic team information and load it (<a href="https://github.com/PioneersTeam1676/FRTree/commit/6dcfbbbeadcad37644b2fa648eeda9c60622f1f0">commit 6dcfbbb</a>). This actually was quite difficult, as formatting the data properly tested the data transfer systems and prompted some frontend reworks, so once it was intact, the profile pages were in a very good state.

    <p>
        Then, after two days of coding only on this project, I completed a basic authentication system, which put the website in an accessible state (<a href="https://github.com/PioneersTeam1676/FRTree/commit/497274d4fa764db9ad1d20033bfa9ffa404112cc">commit 497274d</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        My last changes were about the user API and adding some admin features, along with an editor, onboarding, and other features. After this, Alex Radu redesigned the styling a lot- the appearance of the website is NOT my work. It looks amazing, though.
