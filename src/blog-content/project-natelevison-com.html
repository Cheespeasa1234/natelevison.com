        Where do I even start? I started this website in 2022, and it has grown up with me since then. It is truly my greatest achievement ever. And I really love this site. I love the weird writing from older days, and I love exploring the archive to see what nonsense I was getting up to. The development is always fun and I am so glad to have this website represent me to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        The modern website is built on SvelteKit, with a custom blog system that I will detail later. It has a glossary system, a search, and tags and other forms of organization. I host it on a DigitalOcean Ubuntu droplet, using Nginx as the reverse proxy. I use Cloudflare as my domain registrar and I use their other services as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, let's start by telling a history of this website.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Before I start, quickly, I will be using the <a href="https://github.com/Cheespeasa1234/natelevison.com">"new" repo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Cheespeasa1234/old">old repo</a> as reference, along with some older blog posts. I will also use my college essay as reference. So lets start with the original website.
    </p>
    <h3>Single page hosting</h3>
    <p>
        In the very beggining, there was a website where I would upload a single HTML file and it would be uploaded there. I have no idea what it was called, but that was my only understanding of web development. This was circa March 2022, as it was before the original blog. This page just had a list of my favorite foods, if I remember correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I eventually realized I could add another HTML file. At this point, I added a file called <code>blogtest.html</code>, and just wrote the following:
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
        <p>
            This is the first entry. IDK what to put here. I might put a blog. After all, I did name this file blogtest.html. I kind of have an obligation now. Maybe it will be a coding blog.
            So lets start, then? I figured out subpages just now. Funny, cause my previous website didn't use those. Turns out it's just as easy as making subfolders. Next task, getting rid of the "something.html" on the nav. I want it to look clean. Lets see if I can figure that out. I also want to make an icon and a title in the tab. That would be cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I have:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Made a subpage</li>
            <li>Made a hub</li>
            <li>Made this site</li>
            <li>Fallen asleep during class</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I know. Very productive. The goal of this, btw, is not to flex my skill, but just to flex my non-skill. I'm pretty bad at this, so I just want to see how far I can get before I die. Pretty cool. Alright goodbye
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        This was the first entry. Grandma, you might have recognized this. This entry set into motion  a passion for coding and writing that I still have.
    </p>
    
    <h3>000webhost</h3>
    <p>
        000webhost is where things really started to kick off. It was a fully static site host, similar to GitHub pages. I learned subpages, index.html files, and STYLING! Although, if you had looked at the styling back then, you'd have rather me not style it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started adding some little toys and tools to the site, like a mailto link generator, some contact info and an about page, and most importantly, the Wordle Solution Generator. At this point, this was my magnum opus. Some of my family members reached out, saying it was very cool! This was shocking to me. It isn't possible anymore, as wordle stores answers secretly now, but it used to work. I was so proud of it then- not really anymore. The light of god does not shine anywhere near that code.
    </p>

    <h3>GitHub pages</h3>
    <p>
        The GitHub pages website is what I consider the beginning of the golden age of this website. It was hosted on cheespeasa1234.github.io, and was a static site as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Later in this era, I got better at other forms of programming, especially Java, and I started writing more for the website. This is also when I started making LeviSchedule, which would become my greatest achievement (for a bit).
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, I was using most features of static site development, and I began to hit my limit. I began having thoughts of moving to self hosting, and I began research. This transition would take a very long time, but it started here.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Old natelevison.com</h3>
    <p>
        When I first began hosting on my server, I used express.js and a static site folder, so same as before. I began improving the website, and really tried to make it my own. I added a blog around this time, and this is the era of my website that lasted the longest.
    </p>
    <p>
        I began by "revamping" the visuals (they still looked awful) and improving the code. I reorganized some pages and added some new ones, and began developing a brand new blog system. I was starting to write more about my life, and needed a new place for a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is also when my grandma revealed to me she had been reading my website all the time. This was awesome to hear, and is the primary plot point of my personal college essay. I began putting "thanks for reading, Grandma" or something similar at the end of all my articles.
    </p>
    <p>
        When my blog system finally went up, I uploaded frequently, and started to neglect the updates page, which was its own thing now. It is now only for significant updates to the website.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Modern-day natelevison.com</h3>
    <p>
        After some time, the blog system began to grow some cobwebs. It was using string replacing on the backend, and some nasty stuff to work "statically". It was absolutely ABHORRENT code. So I rewrote the whole website in SvelteKit.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also began to redesign the site a final time using Bootstrap, and some other tools. I really enjoyed redesigning it, and I am quite proud of how it looks now! I consolidated some pages and redesigned the blog system from scratch, and I really like how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will serve as a quick explanation before I write a full article on it, but the blog uses xml files which store data about the article and loads them in using a slug and an API endpoint. I made the search code better and it sorts better. I also remade the glossarizer and it is a lot simpler now.

    <h2>Skils</h2>
    <p>
        Obviously, the primary skill I have gained in this experience of making this website is web development. I learned how to use CSS, HTML, and JS, and the current state of this website is pretty much exactly how much I know.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned about version management and documentation, as I would frequently take month-long hiatuses and version control helped me get back on track. I also learned about hosting and GitHub, which has been a toolbelt item ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned about how the internet works, like IPs, DNS, domains, hosting, HTTP, and more, and I learned about hosting, using Ubuntu, services, servers, clients, express.js, Deno, SvelteKit, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This website holds a special place in my heart. It was the place I wrote about dealing with the passing of my Grandma, it's where I went to deal with social isolation, and it shows my learning process and growth so well. This website is like a part of my mind now.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not done with this website; and I hope I will never be. I love what it has become and I have set the groundwork for a dense repository of all of my writings. Expect more articles soon. Thank you for reading, Grandma.
