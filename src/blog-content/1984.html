        A few years ago I read the book <i>1984</i> by George Orwell. It truly changed the way I viewed the world. In that moment, I thought, "<i>No way we ever have to deal with problems like that. I can do whatever I want, especially on the Internet, and with my own money, and my own property.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
        1984 is only a few months away. And I'm not joking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: this article is certainly rather political. However, I am not writing this from a standpoint of critique against a political ideology- it simply comes from an anti-censorship perspective.

    <h3>
        Why 1984 is nearing
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are a few recent events that terrify me. We are nearing a censored, unfree, fascist reality. And I know the word "fascist" is going to upset people, but COMPLETELY isolated from the current American discourse, I truly believe this.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following sections I will explain and argue against a couple of recent events. They are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Children's Safety
        </li>
        <li>
            Visa & Mastercard shutdowns of Adult Listings on Steam & Itch.io
        </li>
        <li>
            Trump berating reporters, asking where they come from
        </li>
        <li>
            Jimmy Kimmel shutdown by FCC
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
        "Children's Safety"
    </h3>
    <p>
        Yeah, sure. First of all, not only is the internet not for kids, it never has been, and never should have been. So many millennial and gen-x parents have raised their kids on the open internet and on iPads that children have infected everything. And everything needs to be dumbed down for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Children can be on the internet, sure. But they had <i>safe havens</i> when I was younger. For example, Roblox. Roblox used to have a heavily censored chat, simple kids games, and few payment options. Nowadays, not only is Roblox dipping their toes into DATING of all things, they allow and encourage pedophiles and financial criminals to employ their predominantly underage userbase, and they milk money from mom's credit card at every turn. They also have inappropriate skins, clothes, and "experiences"<span

    </p>
    <p>
        And as the adults who were above age when they witnessed the internet be created, they never considered what the point of the internet even was. It was for free, private, and spanerse conversation, speech, and free information. This information isn't always tasteful, and that's the point. "Tasteful" information can easily be redefined and molded to the pleasure of the government- something that Big Brother did often in 1984.

    <h3>Payment Processor shutdowns of Adult Listings on Steam & Itch.io (July 2025)</h3>
    <p>
        Recently, Steam- an online video game marketplace, and Itch.io- an online media and game marketplace, both tore down almost all of their adult-rated listings<span 
            class="source"

        First of all, there is absolutely no reason to do so. The internet is NOT a safe haven for children- it never was- and it should never be. The responsibility of raising children is solely on the parents.
    </p>
    <p>
        They did this because, according to Valve (company who runs Steam), the companies received threats from the credit card companies they use for checkout<span class="source" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/"></span>, about taking down "fetish content", including most LGBTQIA+ content, "adult" games, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now some people will tell you that <i>some parents don't have the resources to raise their kids without the internet</i>. That may be true. But the thing is, you don't need to raise them on the open internet. You can raise them <i>with</i> parts of it, like approved TV shows, approved gaming sites, and approved messaging apps with REAL LIFE FRIENDS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keyword? Approved. There are plenty of options, free and paid, for limiting and tracking screen usage and activity for children<span class="source" href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-parental-control-apps/"></span>. Additionally, plenty of apps and devices nowadays have remove parental control features. It surely can't be <i>too</i> hard to just... monitor your kid? And even if a child is left behind and is thrown into the open internet, it's not anyone's fault, and shouldn't be cause for censorship. Kids get into shit they shouldn't <i>all the time</i>. For example: drugs, legal documents, vehicles, alcohol. But we don't ban these things to protect the kids, because we acknowledge it is the responsibility of the parent to handle these things.

    <h3>
        Trump berating and insulting reporters, asking where they come from, and removing press pool access (April 2025)
    </h3>
    <p>
        This is the most blatant censorship I have seen lately. Everyone has seen the videos. Trump gets asked a difficult question, and instead of answering, he resorts to the following responses:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The reporter who asked is a failure, not a real reporter, bad at their job, etc.</li>
        <li>Interrogating them about who they work for</li>
        <li>Criticizing them for coming from another country's media</li>
        <li>Threaten the reporter</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        And then later, he determined that the government would manage the press pool<span class="source" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/trump-white-house-press-pool-access-00206001"></span><span class="source" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/media/latest-media-crackdown-white-house-limits-newswire-access-trump-rcna201520"></span>, instead of an independent committee of journalists. 
    </p>
    <sub>
        And yes, I recently found out Biden did the same<span class="source" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/flashback-biden-also-changed-white-house-press-pool-cutting-off-more-than-440-reporters-credentials"></span>. Unfortunately, I never heard about this, or I would've protested it as well. It is simply that I am currently the most educated I have ever been, and that happens to be at the time when Trump is president. Rest assured, if someone else were in power, and this happened, I would still be upset.
    </sub>
    <p>
        This means he could take away or deprioritize press pool access to any reporters or networks he determined unfavorable. AND HE HAS. When AP News refused to call the Gulf of Mexico by the new name, Gulf of America, the White House barred the AP from the press pool, including critical press locations like Air Force One and private conferences<span class="source" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/media/latest-media-crackdown-white-house-limits-newswire-access-trump-rcna201520"></span>. A federal judge even found this as a violation of the protections of free speech<span class="source" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/media/latest-media-crackdown-white-house-limits-newswire-access-trump-rcna201520"></span>. (I could not find an update to this case.)
    </p> 
    <p>
        It doesn't matter if one network is supposedly spreading false information. (Even though it's called the Gulf of Mexico by every country out there, pretty much.) That's the media. AND IT'S THEIR RIGHT. If the president can remove press access to anyone at anytime, that's not a president, that's a dictator with government-controlled-media. It's completely wrong. It literally can not be justified. (I'll talk about this more later.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, Trump recently berated an Australian reporter for asking him about whether or not it was fine that he was doing business dealings while in office<span class="source" href="https://7news.com.au/news/donald-trump-blasts-australian-journalist-in-heated-exchange-at-white-house-c-20044535"></span>. He threatened the reporter and said he would tell the PM of Australia about him, and he refused to answer the question. (Telling.)
    </p>
    <p>
        He's done this on multiple other occasions... but nothing like what happened to Jimmy Kimmel.

    <h3>Jimmy Kimmel</h3>
    <p>
        I wrote the previous section a few weeks ago. So I retract my statement that the press pool removal scandal was "...the most blatant censorship I have seen lately." I was wrong. The most blatant was the FCC Chairman Brendan Carr successfully threatening ABC into removing Jimmy Kimmel Live! from air<span class="source" href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/18/did-the-fcc-cancel-jimmy-kimmel"></span><span class="source" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-jimmy-kimmels-show-was-suspended-a-key-question-is-does-the-fcc-have-the-power-to-regulate-speech"></span><span class="source" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/4-things-to-know-about-abcs-suspension-of-jimmy-kimmels-late-night-show"></span><span class="source" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-defends-abc-affiliates-pulling-jimmy-kimmel-show-after-monologue-mocking-charlie-kirk"></span><span class="source" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fcc-chair-levels-threat-against-abc-disney-after-kimmel-suggested-charlie-kirk-assassin-maga"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        They did this because, during his show, he said that Robinson was a supporter of Trump, thus it would be wrong to blame the left for the assassination of Kirk, and because he supposedly made light of the assassination<span class="source" href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/18/did-the-fcc-cancel-jimmy-kimmel/"></span><span class="source" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-defends-abc-affiliates-pulling-jimmy-kimmel-show-after-monologue-mocking-charlie-kirk"></span>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This makes me <b>sick</b>. I'm honestly terrified. This is it. This is literally it. This is what I've been warning people about. The moment we let it slide that the government can threaten stations into taking people off the air for what they say- no matter how egregious, if they didn't break any laws- then the government can control everything. That would be it- the last bastion of free speech.
    </p>
    <sub>Note: I said "if they didn't break any laws", in reference to the Alex Jones scandal<span class="source" href="https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-ripped-parkland-parent-after-raising-florida-texas-shootings-1751374"></span>. I'm pretty sure no laws were broken, but he lost the lawsuit. I'm not sure what other words to use here. I said this because I did actually support any attempt to take Jones off the air.</sub>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Talking about this stuff is tiring. Really tiring. It takes a lot of research, and really hurts your state of mind. I will <i>never</i> give up hope and faith in this country. I love this country. I love free speech. And I will defend it until the day I die.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the powers that be <i>want</i> this argument to be tiring. They want us to give up. It's easier to be censored than to be free. But wars have been fought over free speech. Our forefathers laid down their lives over some stupid tea taxes, and gave us these rights; it would be a dishonor to them to give up these hard-fought rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those of you who know me will know I took Honors Holocaust Literature last year (2024-2025). In this class, we learned about how the Nazis came to power for the first two or so months. This unit changed my perspective on free speech. It's not only a convenient right that makes our lives better; it is life or death. The Jews in Warsaw sacrificed their lives to document the events in that ghetto- and without their reporting, we'd be in the dark. Jews in ghettos across Europe died trying to be free. And we shall not go down without a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have purposely neglected to provide a specific call to action here. Why? Honestly, I don't know what do to except not shutting up about this. I <i>guess</i> I could reach out to my representatives, but not only have I done that already, but my representative has already spoken out against the FCC Kimmel scandal<span class="source" href="https://gottheimer.house.gov/posts/release-gottheimer-statement-on-fcc-chairs-threats-to-free-speech"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any government limitation of speech should be met with fierce critique and analysis. <i>Some</i> government management of speech is necessary for a legal system to exist... but it's like medical fentanyl, for example. If it makes any sense, medical fentanyl is carefully regulated and used only when it is the precise solution to an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        So yeah. I'm worried about this country. But in the way a parent would be if their kid got into the wrong crowd. I haven't given up on this country. And I will not. Thanks for reading, grandma.
