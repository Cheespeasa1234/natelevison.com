        I've been playing <i>Mario Kart World</i> and <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> interchangably since World came out in June, and honestly, I've come to the opinion that <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> (MK8DX) was, and kinda still is, better.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a couple of reasons why, but I'm just writing this in a flow, so I'm not gonna do the hamburger thing where you explain your main points beforehand. Yeah.

    <h3>Track Selection</h3>
    <p>
        Although the tracks in World are more open-world oriented, I do prefer how MK8DX did it. You can't have brilliant tracks like Electrodrome or Big Blue in the world of <i>Mario Kart World</i>. We can see this, because <i>Mario Kart World</i>'s rendition of Rainbow Road is brilliant! It uses all the details, antigravity, a complex track design, and it is completely in an isolated environment, as opposed to the connected world of the other 29 tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of 29 tracks- really? I know that 96 tracks and 8 battle courses is a LOT for a game to follow up from, but 29 is really lackluster. Yeah, sure, there are <i>technically</i> two Peach Stadiums and two Crown City's, but screw that. The second Peach Stadium is LITERALLY a square and the second Crown City is so forgettable, completely out performed by the time trial rendition of Crown City.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing I will discuss later- I usually like to play online races. And in online races in MK8DX, every track has an equal chance to be put into the vote. Yeah, some tracks aren't fan favorites and thus aren't played as often, but they all get an equal chance every time, and you can always select a random course to play a truly random course.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in World, your options are based on the location in the map you are currently in. So, you don't get to play Rainbow Road, or DS Airship Fortress, or GCN Dino Dino Jungle very often. For Rainbow Road, you can only vote on it if you are currently at Peach Stadium- and for DS Airship Fortress and GCN Dino Dino Jungle, it's slightly rare to get them as an option. So, given a random walk, you tend to only be able to vote on the more central courses, and stay in the same area while in a lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, with the original courses in World, I don't think they stack up to the originals of MK8. 8 had BANGERS and ICONS like Electrodrome, Big Blue, and Shy Guy Falls, which are incredible tracks that don't really have a reasonable real life counterpart (except for Mount Wario. It's really good but could've worked in an open world). Meanwhile, the original courses in World are... a city... a savanna... starview peak... a lava thing... sure, they are amazing tracks, but I just don't love them as much.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also... the retros! What a disgrace! Sure, fan favorites like DS Airship Fortress, 3DS Wario Shipyard... I guess... but not a SINGLE course from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe? The BEST SELLING NINTENDO GAME OF ALL TIME? Not Sunshine Airport- a literal airport- or Mount Wario- a literal mountain which would be perfect for the snow area- and none of the other originals from MK8. Instead, we get SKY HIGH FUCKING SUNDAE. THE WORST TRACK <i>EVVVVER</i>. Seriously Nintendo? I'd rather you shit in your hand and serve it to me. What a disgrace.

    <h3>Online Play</h3>
    <p>
        "I'm using tilt controls!" is DEAD. They got rid of it! And for what reason? I LOVED saying that I was using tilt controls, it was one of the few ways to express personality and to joke around in lobbies given Nintendo's censorship. And they removed it. This really made me sad when I first found this out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing! The intermissions. With <i>Mario Kart World</i>s gimmick, you can drive between the tracks to get to the next round, as it is all in one map. But these are just straight lines with a few bends here and there. BORING. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the first few weeks of World, you could choose a random course instead, and always get a standard course. But Nintendo removed this for no good reason. This single-handedly made me stop playing <i>Mario Kart World</i> online, and I have permanently returned to MK8DX online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside the abysmal voting system, the random walk feature of track voting is miserable. If there is a track in mind you want to play, in MK8DX, you always have a chance to vote on it. But in World, you have to vote against your own interest to bring the races closer to your desired destination. But if your favorite course is really far away, or a fan-hated course, you're shit out of luck, really. There's nothing you can do except vote for intermissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Honestly. There's no charm to the online mode in World. Sure, there are more options. But I just don't like it. It's still fine for casual players, but why would I subject myself to an hour of intermission tracks just praying I land on DS Airship Fortress or Rainbow Road, when I can just play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe online, spam "I'm using tilt controls!", and have a chance every time to play GBA Cheese Land?

    <h3>Time Trialing</h3>
    <p>
        I don't have much to say here, except for that the physics in MK8DX are slightly more advanced and it makes time trialing so much more fun. And, they got rid of 200cc in World for no good reason, and you can't view lap times as easily. It stinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sure, there are some improvements, like rewinding, and easier pausing, but I just don't care. Shame.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        So yeah. For those three reasons, I honestly have been playing MK8DX again. Not sure how to feel about all of this, but I wanted to write my opinions down now in case they change or something. Thanks for reading, grandma!
