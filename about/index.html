                    <p>
                        I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for learning and creating, currently a student at Pascack Hills High School. I enjoy simple things, like gardening, cooking, my dog, and writing over-complicated programs to automate things I could do manually in 5 minutes. I enjoy learning new programming skills and methods, with the help of my friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned the concepts of programming many years ago, in Elementary School. But I have only formally programmed for two years, by starting out in Java, building GUIs and games. I also learned static web development at the same time, where I built <a class="about-lnk" href="https://static.natelevison.com/old">my first website</a>. I frequently have taken on passion projects, sometimes leading me out of my comfort zone.
                    </p>

                        I always have valued honesty, so I would be lying if I said I was a perfect person. But I also value kindness, so I volunteer occasionally, in various fields. I couldn't have gotten to where I am without the kindness that my friends have shown me, which is why I value and appreciate it so much.
                    </p>
