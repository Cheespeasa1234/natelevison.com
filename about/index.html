    <h2>About Nate Levison</h2>
    <p>
      Nate Levison is an aspiring computer programmer who likes full-stack development, game programming, and learning
      new things. He is a dog person and a video game enjoyer.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Nate is skilled in many programming languages, and he can take on any challenge thrown his way. These languages
      are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> Java (1.5y)</li>
      <li><i class="fa-brands fa-html5"></i> Web2 (1.2y)</li>
      <li><i class="fa-brands fa-node-js"></i> Node.js (1.2y)</li>
      <li><i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> Python (8m)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      He particuarily enjoys making simple websites to screw around with and try new things on.
    </p>
    <h3>Accomplishments & Creations</h3>
    <p>
      Nate has accomplished many things in his computer career. His greatest accomplishment is making his first
      full-stack website (a private blog for friends). He has also designed many of his own stylesheets and designs
      which he uses on his own projects. Additionally, he has recreated multiple arcade-like games in Java. And lastly,
      he has made multiple machine learning programs in Python.
    </p>
    <h3>Private Life</h3>
    <p>
      Nate enjoys spending time with his family, especially with his dog. He can cook well enough that he won't cause a
      fire, but he still loves mom's cooking. Drop by my house and try some carrot souffl√©. Do it, you won't regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his free time, he likes to code frivolous projects and play Minecraft or Geometry Dash. When he isn't using
      his computer (or his phone), he is probably sleeping!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nate is a energetic, creative, and curious person, who takes every disadvantage he is given and turns it into an
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nate always tries to live by confucian principles, meaning he always makes the choice that is the best for
      everyone, not just himself. He is Jewish and likes learning about Jewish history.
