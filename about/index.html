            <h2>About Nate Levison</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Nathaniel (Nate) Joseph Levison. I am an aspiring professional computer programmer who likes full-stack development, game programming, and learning new techniques and technologies. I am a dog person and a video game enjoyer.
            </p>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>
                I am skilled in many programming languages, and I can take on any challenge thrown my way. These languages are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> Java (1.8y)</li>
                <li><i class="fa-brands fa-html5"></i> Web2 (1.6y)</li>
                <li><i class="fa-brands fa-node-js"></i> Node.js (1.3y)</li>
                <li><i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> Python (1y)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I particuarily enjoy creating simple websites to tinker around with and try new things.
            </p>
            <h3>Accomplishments & Creations</h3>
            <p>
                I have accomplished many things in my computer career. My greatest accomplishment is making my first full-stack website (a private blog for friends). I have also designed many of my own stylesheets and designs which I uses on my own projects. Additionally, I have recreated multiple arcade-like games in Java. And last, but not least, I have made multiple machine learning programs in Python.
            </p>
            <h3>Private Life</h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy spending time with my family, especially with my dog. I can cook well enough that I won't cause a fire, but I still love my mom's cooking. Drop by my house and try some carrot souffl√©. I promise you won't regret it.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my free time, I like to code frivolous projects and play Minecraft or Geometry Dash. When I am not using my computer (or phone), I am probably sleeping!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an energetic, creative, and curious person, who takes every disadvantage given and turns it into an advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will always try to live by Confucian principles, meaning I always make the choice that is the best for everyone, not just myself. I is Jewish and I like learning about Jewish history.
            </p>
